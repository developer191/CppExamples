# CppExamples

I am planning on doing a few videos where I show how you can create a few fun example projects
with C++. The source code for these projects will be uploaded here.

To compile these proejcts you will need GCC, Autoconf, Automake, Libtool

For the OpenCV examples you will need:

OpenCV (on debian package named: libopencv-dev)

# Example01 - Fun Hello World

This is a program that instead of just printing out Hello World, it prints out its own source code.

# Example02 - Swap Tabs with Spaces

This simple program will replace all tabs with desired amount of spaces using the standard library iostream, and string.

# Example03 - Basic Autotools proejct

This shows how to setup a basic autotools project

# Example04 - Creating a shared library with Autotools/Libtool

This shows how to setup a basic autotools project for creating a shared library

# Example05 - Using our shared library from example04

This shows how to use the shared library we created

# Example06 - How to compile OpenCV program 

This shows how you can create a program with opencv after you built the code from source

# Example07 - How to create a Stop Watch timer

This shows how you can create a template for a stop watch to time how long parts of your code take to execute

# Example08 - How to Cross Compile Example07

This shows how you can cross compile with arm-gnueabihf for Raspberry Pi

# Example09 - Part 1 How to use libacidcam in your own projects

Requires  autoconf, automake, libtool, OpenCV

# Example09 - Part 2 How to compile libacidcam / example program on Linux

Requires autoconf, automake, libtool, libopencv-dev
